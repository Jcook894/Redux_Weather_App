# Weather App

### About ###
This Weather app is built using redux and react. I also used openweathermap API to get the weather data, Sparklines API to create the charts, and google maps for the locations you searched for.


#### How to run #####
To download this app, clone it or unzip it and then in the root directory in your terminal...

```javascript
	> npm install
	> npm start

```

### Dev server ###
Once you run npm start, it will start up a dev server. The dev server will be on

```javascript
    > localhost:8080
    
```
